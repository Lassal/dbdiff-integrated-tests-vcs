  package dbms_debug_jdwp_custom authid current_user is -- This is the default implementation of the custom package
  -- procedure that will be invoked to process a debug connection request
  -- that arrives in the form of an ORA_DEBUG_JDWP environment variable.
  -- This default implemenation is owned by SYS and is made available
  -- to public via a public synonym.
  --
  -- The default implementation of this procedure does not perform any
  -- additional security checks.  A request to connect the session to a
  -- debugger will be controlled only by the DEBUG CONNECT privilege
  -- requirements.  A database user who wants to perform custom security
  -- checks as well can override this default implementation by defining
  -- this same package in his or her own schema and implementing the
  -- check in that local copy.
  -- The arguments to the custom package procedure must all be of varchar2
  -- type or of types which PL/SQL can implicitly convert to varchar2.
  --
  -- A programmer who wants to customize the handling of the debug connection
  -- request may override this default implementation of the package procedure
  -- by installing the same package (specification and body) with a procedure
  -- of the same name in his own schema.  He may customize the number and
  -- names of the arguments to the package procedure.  Only the names of
  -- the package and of the procedure need to remain the same (namely
  -- (DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP_CUSTOM and CONNECT_DEBUGGER respectively).  The
  -- programmer's customized version of the package may contain overloaded
  -- versions of the procedure CONNECT_DEBUGGER with different arguments.
